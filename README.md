Node Editor for GTK

A powerful and versatile node editor built with `gtkmm4` and `C++`, designed to offer a wide range of features for creating and managing nodes and their interconnections dynamically. This tool is especially suited for applications requiring a graphical interface to manage complex data flows, such as graphical programming environments, data pipeline management tools, and more.

## Features

- **Node Manipulation**: Easily add and delete nodes within the editor.

- **Embedded Widgets**: Nodes can contain various elements, including spin buttons, color selectors, checkboxes, labels, and switches and more, providing a highly flexible interface for user interaction.
- **Cycle Detection**: Prevents the creation of edges that would result in a cyclic graph, ensuring data flow integrity.

- **Signal Propagation**: Changes in a node's internal elements are propagated to all connected nodes, ensuring the system remains up-to-date with the latest changes.
- **Custom Theming**: Offers extensive theming options, allowing for the customization of colors, sizes, fonts, and overall theme to match user preference or application requirements.
- **Rubberband Selection**:  Enables to select multiple nodes and edges by clicking and dragging a rectangle, or "rubberband", around them.

- **Undo-Redo**:Allows users to revert and reapply actions in a sequential order, enhancing the editing process by providing the flexibility to easily correct mistakes or revisit previous states.
